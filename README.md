Solidus - Item Customizations
===========================

Add customizations to your line items and shipments.

A customization is made up of things:
- Customizable - the item (shipment or line item) that is being customized
- Article - the actual customization (i.e. text, image, etc)
- Configuration - responsible for defining the uniqueness of the customization
- Source - responsible for adjusting the item


An example:

A t-shirt can be customized with a graphic on the front and a line of text on the back.

Two "configurations", one representing the graphic, one representing the text. 
Two "articles", one representing the graphic, one representing the text.
One "customizable", a line item.
